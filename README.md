# State of the Tech Labor Market

In the last few months, headlines about tech layoffs have been flashing across everyone's screens.

Since the beginning of this year, -- people in the industry have lost their jobs. 

Given the massive recent layoffs in the tech sector, I thought it would be helpful to take a deeper look at the state of the tech market to get a sense of what is really going on behind the scenes -- and to see whether there is hope for any of us out there who are looking for a job.

This dashboard is split into three sections - the first will give a general sense of economic conditions in the sector and more generally, the second will take a closer look at recent layoffs and predict whether companies will experience multiple rounds or just a one off, and the third will 
focus on job postings
